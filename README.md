# What is ERC-998?

ERC-998 is an extension to the ERC-721 standard that adds the ability for non-fungible tokens to own other non-fungible tokens and to own ERC-20 tokens.

Non-fungible tokens that implement ERC998 also implement the ERC-721 standard.

The official ERC-998 standard is at this link: [EIP-998](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-998)
